**Title:** QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation
**Authors:** Chinonso Onah, Neel Miscasci, Carsten Othmer, Kristel Michielsen
**Abstract:** We compare solutions to a transportation problem using a Gurobi-based solver and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. The problem is encoded as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation demonstrates success.
