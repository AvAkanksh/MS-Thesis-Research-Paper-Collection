- **Completeness**: While exhaustive, some niche or proprietary models may not be publicly documented. If you need details on a specific model or its implementation, let me know!


## Sugarscape mode (foundational model of ABM)

- The Sugarscape model, developed by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell in the 1990s, is a foundational agent-based model (ABM) primarily used to study social, economic, and ecological systems. However, it is not included in the previous list of ABM models used in the finance sector because its primary applications lie outside of finance-specific contexts, such as market simulations, trading strategies, or financial risk analysis. Below, I explain why Sugarscape is not typically considered a finance-focused ABM and clarify its relevance:
Reasons Sugarscape is Not Included in the Finance-Specific ABM List:

- General-Purpose ABM Framework:
    - Sugarscape is a versatile ABM designed to explore broad social and economic phenomena, such as wealth distribution, migration, trade, and cultural dynamics. It simulates agents foraging for resources (e.g., sugar) on a grid, with rules for movement, consumption, and interaction.
    - While it includes economic concepts like resource scarcity and trade, these are abstract and not tailored to financial markets, trading behaviors, or financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, derivatives).
- Lack of Direct Financial Applications:
    - The Sugarscape model is not commonly cited in financial literature for applications like stock market dynamics, portfolio management, or systemic risk analysis, which were the focus of the provided list.
