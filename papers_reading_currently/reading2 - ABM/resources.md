### Notes on Accessing and Studying

- **Accessing Papers**: Many of these are available through academic databases like JSTOR, ScienceDirect, or Google Scholar. For open-access papers, check platforms like arXiv or ResearchGate. If you hit a paywall, consider requesting access via institutional libraries or contacting authors directly.
- **Study Approach**: Start with review articles (e.g., Axtell & Farmer, 2025) for a broad overview, then dive into specific applications (e.g., Geanakoplos et al., 2012, for systemic risk). For practical implementation, explore Tesfatsion & Judd (2006) or Hamill & Gilbert (2016). Papers like Lux (2018) and Glielmo et al. (2023) are ideal for advanced calibration techniques.
- **Recent Trends**: Focus on works from 2020–2025 (e.g., SmythOS articles, ResearchGate 2025 paper) for cutting-edge integrations of AI, reinforcement learning, and big data with ABM.
- **Validation and Calibration**: Pay attention to validation challenges discussed in Barde (2016) and Fabretti (2013), as these are critical for applying ABM to real-world financial markets.
